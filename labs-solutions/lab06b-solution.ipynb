    "## Logit and Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's turn to logit models. These models have been used in a variety of settings and fields, but are often called **classifiers** in a machine learning context. For logit models, the dependendent (i.e. Y variable or LHS variable) is a **binary** outcome, or 0/1 value. So, did you do something or not? Can we classify this observation? \n",
    "\n",
    "Logits are again covered in **Hull, Chapters 3 and 10**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Logit models are also covered in [Chapter 13 of our notes](https://aaiken1.github.io/fin-data-analysis-text/chapters/13_logit_credit.html). I work through the Hull examples there.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the way, you can also use what are called [multi-nomial logit models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_logistic_regression) for non-binary outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "You're going to see **more math now**, especially if you want to understand more about what's going on under-the-hood, so to speak. Do you understand what these different models are trying to do? Why we use them?\n",
    "\n",
    "Use our online notes to complete our labs. I have my own commentary and links that will help. You can work through the parts below in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are getting errors and are not sure why, my first suggestion is always to **Restart** the Python kernel, to **Clear All Output**, and run each code cell **one-by-one** from the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let each code cell represent one idea, or output. Take advantage of **Markdown** in your write-up. Use headers and formatting. Here's a [Markdown cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) that I keep handy. Once you figure out some of the basics, you might not want to go back to Word or Google Docs. "

    "You are trying to predict **loan status**. You should extend the model from Chapter 3 to include additional features, such as the loan amount, term, interest rate, grade, verification status, and purpose of loan. Use regularization as appropriate. Report on the performance of the model you consider to be best. Finally, how might Lending Tree use this data and models to set interest rates?\n",
    "\n",
    "Seems easy, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pay attention to your workflow**. Doing things out of order is going to create major headaches. These tips follow my workflow and trouble I ran into.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You're again bringing in an Excel file, so you might need to specify exactly how you need to do that. \n",
    "\n",
    "- I look at my data **a lot**. I use `lt.columns` a lot, where `lt` is what I called my data frame. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pay attention to data types**. Print out all of your variables and take a look. Are your numeric variables numeric? Do you need to remove any text from some variables? Need to fix any missing values? Or just drop those rows? What are the steps to go from text variables to indicators using `pd.get_dummies()`? You want 1/0 variables to go into your models - True and False might not work. Does **loan status** itself need some work? I created my own loan status variable using the one in the data. You'll have to make some choices about the data. Make sure that you understand what each variable is measuring.\n",
    "\n",
    "- OK, one last time. Print all of your variables names. Use `.describe()`. Look for missings. **Only move on if you have what you want.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Standardize your variables **only** after you have cleaned your features and only included what you need in the **X** data frame. I used the `.StandardScaler()' method, rather than do things \"by hand\", like in the Hull book.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Split your data into **training** and **testing** sub-sets, but, again, **only after everything is cleaned up**. You can also do **training**, **validation**, and **testing**, like the text. See the notes for more. The general idea is the same, regardless. \n",
    "\n",
    "- You are going to fit your model using the testing data. I started by using `smf.logit`, rather than `sklearn`. I had to combine my **y_train** and **X_train** dataframes, since `smf.logit` wants everything in the same place (or, at least its easier that way). I then specified my **formula**, where my new loan_status variable was my y variable, the thing I'm trying to predict. To start, I used just annual income, dit, FICO, loan amount, term, and interest rate as my X, or independent, or explanatory, variables. See the notes for more.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why use `smf.logit`, rather than `sklearn`, like in the Hull book? I like the output. `sklearn` isn't concerned with the coefficients, t-stats, etc. I like to see the model output, if I can, especially I have some idea what the variables mean and what they might predict. Even when doing machine learning, I think that **econnomic interpretation** is important. For example, is the sign on annual income \"correct\"? \n",
    "\n",
    "- Now, try using `smf.logit` and include all of your `grade_` indicators. So, `grade_A`, `grade_B`, etc. Print the summary. Does anything look off to you?\n",
    "\n",
    "- See all of those *nan* values? This model didn't actually run. Why? We included an **intercept** and all of the indicators/dummies for **grade**. This is an example of the **dummy variable trap** discussed in Hull, Chapter 3 and the notes. From Chat GPT:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The dummy variable trap, also known as the dummy variable multicollinearity trap, occurs in regression analysis when categorical variables are represented as dummy variables (0 or 1) in a regression model, and one dummy variable can be predicted from the others. For example, consider a categorical variable \"color\" with three categories: red, blue, and green. To include this variable in a regression model, you might create two dummy variables: \"is_blue\" and \"is_green\". If you include all three dummy variables (including \"is_red\") in the model, it would create perfect multicollinearity because \"is_red\" can always be inferred from \"is_blue\" and \"is_green\" (if both are 0, then it must be red).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pd.get_dummies` is using a method called **one-hot encoding**. Every value in a column gets \"pulled out\" and mode its own column, with values of *True* or *False*. We then convert these to 1/0. The problem comes when [inverting the matrix when estimating the model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity). You can't do that when some combination of columns perfectly predicts another, as described above. How can you fix this? You should **only include k-1 of your indicators**, where k is the total number of indicator variables for that category (e.g. color above). Then, everything is relative to the one group that you left out, if you're trying to interpret your model. If you're just predicting, don't worry about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keep using `smf.logit` to run your model and print the summary. But, now, include all of the dummy variables, excluding one from each category. See how your formula is getting really long, because you have so many features? You can split a formula across multiple lines using a single `\\` like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "formula = 'loan_status_ind ~ annual_inc + dti + fico_range_low + loan_amnt + term + int_rate + \\\n",
    "            grade_B + grade_C + grade_D + grade_E + grade_F + grade_G + \\\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Let's move to the `sklearn` method, like in the Hull book**. Take the **X_train** data frame and **drop the variables that you don't want to include**. I would save this as a new training set. Note that sometimes its easier to drop columns, while other times it's easier to use `.loc` and keep columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Try doing a `sklearn` logit with just the numeric variable. Print the coefficients. Add those grade indicators. Check and see if your answer is close to what you got with the `smf.logit` method. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Try the logit with everything you included in the final `smf.logit` model. To get mine to run, I needed to change my method and the max number of iterations. The logit model is \"searching\" for coefficients to solve the model. There are various ways to go about this and you can change how long it tries. Add this to code where you define the `LogisticRegression` object:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "solver=\"sag\", max_iter = 5000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Between the two methods, my coefficients were close, but not exactly the same. Estimating logits gets \"tricky\" when you have so many features included in the model and multicollinearity is a problem, even after fixing the dummy variables. You can actually run LASSO and Ridge models with logit using `sklearn`. By using **regularization**, we can help mitigate the \"too many features\" issue, just like with linear regression. You'll notice that we haven't discussed **hyperparameters** here - that's because a regular logit classifier doesn't have them! However, the training-testing split is still useful, as you're about to see. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Once you've estimated the model with all of your features, let's try some **prediction**. Follow along with the Hull text and online notes to generate **predicted values** using your training data and `lgstc_reg.predict_proba()`. Turn the probabilities into binary predictions, like in the notes. You'll need to pick a **threshold** to do this. Your threshold (e.g. 0.85) turns a probability into a 1/0 prediction. If the predicted probability is above the threshold, you get a 1, else 0. Create a **confusion matrix** for a variety of thresholds. See the notes and the Hull book for more on confusion matrices. You're trying to get a sense for the number predictive power and the number of mistakes made by your model. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, once you have a threshold that you like, use your model with the **X_test** features that you held out to predict loan status. Compare these predictions with the **y_test** hold out sample. Use your threshold from the training step above to create binary predictors and another confusion matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "- I like to look at the mean value of the predicted values compared to the mean values of the actual values. For example, if my loan status is actually good 90% of the time, is the average of my predicted values also around 90%? Just a quick eyeball test to help with my thresholds. **The book and notes give you better ways to evaluate thresholds**. The threshold is kind of like our hyperparater here.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What do you think? Is predicting loan default easy or difficult? How might you use this model if you were at FinTech doing loan underwriting? What trade-offs do you face?"

It is an alias for the notna method with the boolean values inverted.\n",
